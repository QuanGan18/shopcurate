	<h2><font size="6">WHAT IS YOUR RETURNS POLICY?</font></h2>
	<h4>Last updated 11/22/2019 6:11 PM</h4>
	<p>We want to make sure returns are as easy as possible to do, but if you need more information on our Returns Policy, how to returns or the process then scroll down.</p>

<p><strong>Christmas Returns</strong><br>
We've extended our Returns Policy for Christmas 2019. Orders placed from 01 November 2019 - 24 December 2019 can be returned up until 31 January 2020, for a full refund back to your original payment method.</p>

<p><strong>Orders returned after 31 January 2020</strong><br>
If you return your order between 29-45 days of it being delivered, you'll receive your refund in the form of a gift voucher and are subject to our Returns Policy.</p>

<p><strong>November 2019</strong><br>

<p><strong>CURATE Returns Policy Update - What's going on?</strong><br>

You might have heard we've updated our returns policy - it's been all over the news!<br>

First, we've extended the time you get to make a return and get a refund from 28 days to 45 days (you'll get a gift voucher as your refund if you return between 29 and 45 days)!<br>

We've also added in a fair use change to the policy. We know the vast majority of you are awesome and loyal CURATE customers but sadly, there are a few people who are spoiling the fun e.g. some people are ordering and returning loads (way, waaaaay) more than even the most loyal CURATE customer would order and some are wearing their CURATE purchases out and about, then returning them for a refund. By cutting down on wasteful and unnecessary returns by people taking advantage (not in a good way) of our returns offer, we can maintain our great prices and service, do our bit to help the environment and look into ways of making your CURATE experience even better!<br>

We get that some of the news headlines sound a bit scary, but if you read the policy, you'll see this change is really unlikely to affect you.<br>

So please don't worry, we've got you - you can still buy more than one size or colour, and yes, you can totally make returns if you don't like something or it doesn't look or fit right. <br>

Just to add, we've always said that someone can't buy and then wear clothes out and about and then send them back to get a refund - that's not anything new - it's just super cheeky! <br>

Thanks for being an awesome CURATE customer and read on for the full Returns Policy. <br>
